export const questionText = `# Two Sum Problem

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers in nums such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

### Example:
\`\`\`
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1]
\`\`\`

### Follow-up Questions:
1. What is the time complexity of your solution?
2. Can you think of an optimized approach?
3. How would you handle edge cases?

Please walk through your approach and explain your thinking.`;
